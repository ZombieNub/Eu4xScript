Context and notes for match:
Every scalable modifier has a name and a number, which can either be positive or negative. Note that being positive or
negative doesn't necessarily mean said modifier is good or bad to have.
All modifiers appear as such:
idea_name = {
    modifier_name = number
}

Needs to not match:
government = tribal
factor = 0.45
num_of_cities = 20
vassal = 2
